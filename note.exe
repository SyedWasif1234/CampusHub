🔍 Description

    Create a backend API for a campus portal system where users have different 
    roles (Student, Faculty, Admin). Each role has specific permissions to access and
    modify resources like announcements, results, events, and course materials.
    This project helps to understand RBAC, multi-role workflows, and proper access restrictions.

🎯 End Goal

    Express.js API with robust RBAC system
    JWT authentication
    API key requirement
    Role-based route protection
    Postman collection showing user flows for each role
    Modular, clean, production-quality backend

👥 Roles Involved

    Student: View announcements, results, courses
    Faculty: Upload course materials, post announcements
    Admin: Manage users, publish results, full access

📊 Tables to be Created

    users (with role: student, faculty, admin)
    api_keys
    announcements
    results
    courses
    materials

🧾 API Routes to Build

🔐 Auth & API Key:

    POST /auth/register → Register user with a role (default: student)
    POST /auth/login → Login, return JWT
    POST /auth/api-key → Generate API key
    GET /auth/me → Get current user profile

📢 Announcements:

    POST /announcements → Faculty/Admin only
    GET /announcements → Accessible to all roles

🎓 Results:

    POST /results → Admin only
    GET /results/:studentId →
    Student: Only own results
    Faculty/Admin: Any student's results

📚 Courses & Materials:

    GET /courses → All roles
    POST /courses → Admin only
    POST /courses/:courseId/materials → Faculty only
    GET /courses/:courseId/materials → Students & faculty

⚙ Admin-only:

    GET /admin/users → List all users
    PUT /admin/users/:id/role → Change user role

🛡 RBAC Middleware Flow

    Use middleware like checkRole(['admin', 'faculty'])
    Protect each route based on allowed roles
    Combine JWT + API key middleware

🧠 Bonus

    Notification system: Notify students when results/announcements are posted
    Event calendar (create/view events based on role)
    Attendance module (attendances table)
    Course enrollment flow (enrollments table)

✅ Deliverables Checklist

    JWT auth + API Key system
    Role-based access (RBAC for all routes)
    CRUD for announcements, results, courses, materials
    Route protection using middleware
    DB schema + clean relationships
    Postman collection with flows for all 3 roles
    Bonus features (notifications, events, enrollments, attendance)
